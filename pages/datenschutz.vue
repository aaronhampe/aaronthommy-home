          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            This website uses cookies. Cookies are small text files stored on your device. They serve to improve usability, security and performance, and to recognise your browser on subsequent visits.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Most of the cookies we use are session cookies which are deleted automatically after your visit. Other cookies remain on your device until you delete them. These enable us to recognise your browser when you return.

          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            If you contact us via form or email, the data you provide (e.g. name, email address, message content) will be stored and processed for the purpose of handling your enquiry. We do not share this information without your permission.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Processing is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request relates to pre‑contractual or contractual measures. In other cases, processing relies on our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in effectively handling enquiries or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) where obtained.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
            Data submitted via the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion, withdraw consent, or the purpose for storage ceases (e.g. enquiry resolved). Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
